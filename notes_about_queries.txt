How Can Generative AI Understand the Values Stored in a Table Within a Database? (Technically Speaking)

1. Schema Context

First, we provide the AI with the schema (structure) of the table.
This includes column names, data types, and relationships.
This context is usually passed as part of the prompt.
Example:
Table: products
Columns:
- id (INTEGER)
- name (TEXT)
- price (DECIMAL)
- category (TEXT)

Sample data:
id | name            | price   | category
1  | Dell Notebook   | 3500.00 | Computers
2  | USB Mouse       | 50.00   | Peripherals

2. Data Examples

Providing example data helps the AI understand the structure and semantics of the content.
For instance, the AI can infer what "price" represents or what "category" might indicate.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The AI uses NLP techniques to:
Understand the semantic structure of the data.
Map words to concepts.
Relate similar terms (e.g., "price" and "value").

4. Embeddings and Vectorization

Data is converted into numerical representations (vectors).
This allows the AI to:
Identify patterns in the data.
Establish semantic relationships.
Perform comparisons and analyses.

5. Query Generation

Based on its understanding of the data, the AI can:
Generate appropriate SQL queries.
Filter relevant information.
Answer questions about the data effectively.

6. Feedback Loop

The database responses are used to:
- Refine the AIâ€™s understanding.
- Validate assumptions.
- Improve the accuracy of future responses.

Key Considerations for Optimal AI Performance
- Context Quality: The better the schema and examples provided, the more accurately the AI will understand the data.
- Data Structure: Well-organized data ensures better mapping and querying.
- Model Training: The AI's training impacts its ability to interpret and respond.
Question Clarity: Precise questions yield better results.
This process highlights how generative AI bridges natural language inputs with structured database outputs to deliver meaningful insights.
